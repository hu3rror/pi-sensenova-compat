# Coding Standards

Rules for code written in this repository. Agent behavior rules live in `AGENTS.md`. Extend this file as the repo's conventions crystallize.

## Comments

- The code is the source of truth; a comment never is. When a comment and the code disagree, the code wins: fix the comment or delete it.
- Default to no comments for what the code already says — names and structure should be the explanation.
- Comment only what the code cannot express, as a constraint that still binds: hidden constraints, counterintuitive behavior, deliberate deviations, compatibility requirements. When the code changes, update or delete the comment; keep no comment that describes code as it once was.
- Document exported API — symbols other code or packages consume — with doc comments that state the contract (purpose, invariants, units, thread-safety, caller obligations).
- Trade-off rationale and rejected alternatives live in ADRs, not in code comments.

## Error handling

- Handle errors, or propagate them with context (what failed, with what input); silently swallowing an error is a defect. Let tooling flag the mechanical forms (empty `catch`, ignored error returns).
- Errors surfaced to users never leak internals — stack traces, internal paths, queries, secrets. Return a generic message and log the detail.

## Resources

- Acquired resources (handles, connections, locks, temp files) are released on every path, including error paths; prefer scoped owners (`defer`, `with`, RAII, `Drop`) over manual release.

## Tests

- Behavior ships with a test that fails without it; a test that always passes is waste.

## Consistency

- Match the convention of the file you are editing; surrounding style settles style debates, not taste.

## Concurrency

- Shared mutable state has one owner or one synchronization mechanism; keep critical sections minimal, and never hold a lock across blocking work.

## Out of scope

- Updating or merging an existing standards file: the human decides what changes.
- Writing ADRs: rationale belongs in ADRs, and the doc points there.
